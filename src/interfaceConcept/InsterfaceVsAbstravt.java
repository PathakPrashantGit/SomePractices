/*	These	differences	are	based	on	Java	7:
		Interface Abstract	Class
		Methods	of	an	interface	are	abstract	and	
		cannot	have	implementations
		Abstract	class	can	have instance	methods	with	
		default	implementation
		Variables	declared	in	an	interface	are	by	
		default final
		Abstract	class	may	contain	non-final variables	as	a	
		normal	class	would	contain
		Java	interface	is	implemented	by	using	
		keyword	“implements”
		Abstract	class	is	extended	using	keyword	
		“extends”
		Interface	can	extend	another	interface only Abstract	class	can	extend	another	Java	class	and	
		implement	multiple	Java	interfaces
		A	Java	class	can	implement	multiple	
		interfaces
		A	Java	class	can	only	extend	only	one	abstract	
		class
		In	an	interview,	try	not	to	give	answer	in	a	tabular	format.	It	might	give	a	feeling	to	interviewer	
		that	you	have	mugged	up	the	definitions	and	differences.	Instead	try	to	explain	what	they	are,	
		something	like	this.
		Interface	is	like	a	contract	with	the	class,	which	says	I	only	accept	stuff,	which looks	like	the	
		signature	that	I	provide.	And	class	that	implements	the	interface	says,	sure	I	will	make	sure	that	
		I	look	like	that.
		Interface	is	kind	of	a	prototype; there	are	only	signatures	of	methods.	Methods	do	not	have	any	
		implementation;	they	do	not	have	behavior	of	their	own.
		Abstract	class	on	the	other	hand	as	like	classes.	They	look	like	interface	but	they	can	have	
		implementation	of	methods	along	with	abstract	methods.	These	methods	may	or	may	not	have	
		behavior	and	can	be	overridden	in	the	class	that	extends	the	abstract	class.	
		It	like	saying,	abstract	class	tell	the	classes	extending	it,	that	all	the	classes	should	have	
		implemented	methods	in	common	(might	be	overridden)	and	then	these	classes	should	
		implement	the	abstract	methods	also.
